For example,\r\n          if the domain is example.com, the home page is likely located at\r\n          www.example.com/. In some cases, the home page is a site directory,\r\n          particularly when a website has multiple home pages. Wikipedia, for\r\n          example, has a site directory at wikipedia.org that links to every\r\n          language-specific home page, including en.wikipedia.org.\r\n        </p>\r\n      </div>\r\n    </div>\r\n  </div>\r\n</template>\r\n\r\n<script>\r\nexport default {\r\n  name: \"homePage\",\r\n};\r\n</script>\r\n\r\n<style>\r\n#main-tetx {\r\n  margin: 20px;\r\n}\r\n</style>"]},"metadata":{},"sourceType":"module"}
