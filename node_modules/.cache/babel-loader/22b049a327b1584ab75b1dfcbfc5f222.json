For example, if the domain is example.com, the home page is likely located at www.example.com/.\r\n\r\nIn some cases, the home page is a site directory, particularly when a website has multiple home pages. Wikipedia, for example, has a site directory at wikipedia.org that links to every language-specific home page, including en.wikipedia.org.</p>\r\n</template>\r\n\r\n<script>\r\nexport default {\r\n name : 'homePage'\r\n}\r\n</script>\r\n\r\n<style>\r\n\r\n</style>"]},"metadata":{},"sourceType":"module"}
