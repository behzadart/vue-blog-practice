For example, if the domain is example.com,\r\n      the home page is likely located at www.example.com/. In some cases, the\r\n      home page is a site directory, particularly when a website has multiple\r\n      home pages. Wikipedia, for example, has a site directory at wikipedia.org\r\n      that links to every language-specific home page, including\r\n      en.wikipedia.org.\r\n    </p>\r\n  </div>\r\n</template>\r\n\r\n<script>\r\nexport default {\r\n  name: \"homePage\",\r\n};\r\n</script>\r\n\r\n<style>\r\n#main-tetx{\r\n    margin: 20px;\r\n}\r\n</style>"]},"metadata":{},"sourceType":"module"}
