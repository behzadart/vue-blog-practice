        <h1>Home page</h1>
        <p>
          A home page is generally the primary web page which a visitor
          navigating to a website from a search engine will see, and it may also
          serve as a landing page to attract visitors.[3][4] Thus, good home
          page design is usually a high priority for a website.[5] For example,
          a news website may present headlines and first paragraphs of top
          stories, with links to full articles.[6] Usually, the home page is
          located at the root of the website's domain or subdomain. For example,
          if the domain is example.com, the home page is likely located at
          www.example.com/. In some cases, the home page is a site directory,
          particularly when a website has multiple home pages. Wikipedia, for
          example, has a site directory at wikipedia.org that links to every
          language-specific home page, including en.wikipedia.org.
